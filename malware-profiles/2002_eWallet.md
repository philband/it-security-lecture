### Description
> Gator was one of the most reviled companies on the Net. Maker of a free app called eWallet, the firm was 
> under fire for distributing what critics called spyware, code that covertly monitors a user's Web-surfing 
> habits and uploads the data to a remote server. People who downloaded Gator eWallet soon found their screens 
> inundated with pop-up ads ostensibly of interest to them because of Web sites they had visited. Removing eWallet 
> didn't stop the torrent of pop-ups. Mounting complaints attracted the attention of the Federal Trade Commission. 
> Online publishers sued the company for obscuring their Web sites with pop-ups. In a June 2002 legal brief filed 
> with the lawsuit, attorneys for The Washington Post referred to Gator as a "parasite." ZDNet called it a "scourge."

> Today Gator, now called Claria, is a rising star. The lawsuits have been settled - with negligible impact on the
> company's business - and Claria serves ads for names like JPMorgan Chase, Sony, and Yahoo! The Wall Street Journal 
> praises the company for "making strides in revamping itself." Earlier this year, The New York Times reported that 
> Microsoft came close to acquiring Claria. Google acknowledges Claria's technology in recent patent applications. 
> Best of all, government agencies and watchdog groups have given their blessing to the company's latest product: 
> software that watches everything users do online and transmits their surfing histories to Claria, which uses the 
> data to determine which ads to show them. \[cf. [^1]]
