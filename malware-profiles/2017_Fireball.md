### Description

Fireball is a browser hijacker developed in China and was discovered by an israelian software company. They found out, that 250 million computers all around the world were infected and 1/5 of company networks as well[^1]. Fireball takes over your browser and imitates a real browser. That is why you can't no longer echange your browser settings after you have been infected. As well as that it redirects you to different, malicious websites and shows advertisements on every website. As well as that it collects personal data from users. Fireball prevents itself from being removed by anti-malware software. Besides that, Fireball can install browser extension and execute code on computers which makes this Trojan/Adware very dangerous [^2].

Fireball is classified as a Trojan because it is distributed to victims via free software packages imitating a non dangerous browser [^3].
