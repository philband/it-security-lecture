### Description

The SessionManager backdoor enables threat actors to keep persistent, update-resistant and rather stealth access to the IT infrastructure of a targeted organization," Kaspersky revealed on Thursday.

"Once dropped into the victim's system, cybercriminals behind the backdoor can gain access to company emails, update further malicious access by installing other types of malware or clandestinely manage compromised servers, which can be leveraged as malicious infrastructure."

SessionManager's capabilities include, among other features:

- dropping and managing arbitrary files on compromised servers
- remote command execution on backdoored devices
- connecting to endpoints within the victim's local network and manipulating the network traffic
